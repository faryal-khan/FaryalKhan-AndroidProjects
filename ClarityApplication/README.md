# Clarity by The Lantern Clan

The Lantern Clan is a team of six Bryn Mawr College students: Nadine Adnane ('20), Viktoria Braun ('21), Nisha Choudhary ('21), Nitisha Bhandari ('22), Nigina Daniyarova ('22), and Faryal Khan ('22).

Together, the project was created / developed at the second annual Estée Lauder Hackathon at the [Estée Lauder Companies Offices](https://goo.gl/maps/2rhe8NrXioR1QnK38) in Long Island City, NY on October 11 – 12, 2019.

## Background

Through the power of education, increasingly high interest in safe and natural ingredients, and the demand for skin care and makeup products, the idea for Clarity was born. Today's consumers are not only interested in enhancing their natural beauty, but they are also concerned with how they are doing so. Hence, making sure that consumers are aware of what is in the products they use is essential. That's where Clarity comes in.

## Objective

This Android app is designed to allow consumers to look at ingredients in products sold in stores of brands owned by the Estée Lauder Companies. For this hackathon, we focused specificially on a single product sold by Origins.

## Using Clarity

1. Download the prototype folder.
2. Using Android Studio, run the app in an emulator, or export it to your Android device.
3. Scan the QR Code (provided in the Demonstration folder) using the app.

    2. Under the ingredient's name, you should see its source (where it is found), a picture of the source, the purpose of why the ingredient is used, more information about the ingredient, and more products with the ingredient.
